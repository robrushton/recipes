# Chocolate Mousse

## Ingredients
| Amount | Ingredient |
|--------|------------|
| 1 1/2 Cup | Heavy Whipping Cream |
| 3/4 Cup | Milk Chocolate Chips |
| 1/4 Cup | Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips |
| 2 Tbsp | Powdered Sugar |
| 1/2 Tsp| Vanilla Extract |

## Instructions
1. Put chocolate chips and 1/2 cup whipping cream in a double boiler on the stove over medium heat.
2. After the chocolate starts to notably melt, turn the heat down to medium-low.
3. Stir occasionally until melted and smooth.
4. Take the chocolate off the stove and let it come down to room temperature.
5. Add 1 cup of whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract to a bowl.
6. Beat until stiff peaks form.
7. Once the chocolate is room temperature, fold it in to your whipped cream a little bit at a time.
8. Let your mixture chill for 3-12 hours to become firm.
9. Enjoy!

## Notes
1. Adjust the milk/dark chocolate chip mixture to your liking.
2. If you heat up you cream and chocolate mixture too fast, it will start to separate. If this happens, slowy stir and add small amounts of hot water. This can fix the broken emulsion and you may see it become creamy chocolate again.
